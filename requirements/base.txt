# Support for longer (>30 characters) usernames
# Using a fork of the main package because this one provides Django (rather than South) migrations
# This may not actually be needed as SS uses sqlite by default which doesn't really care about length.
# But better to make sure Django doesn't have any validation issues (and also, keep db backend easily swappable)
