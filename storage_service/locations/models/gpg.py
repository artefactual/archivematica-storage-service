    When an AIP is moved to a GPG space, it is encrypted with a

    AIP's pointer file. When the AIP is moved out of a GPG space (e.g., for
    re-ingest, download), it is decrypted. The intended use case is one wherein
    encrypted AIPs may be transfered to other storage locations that are not
    under the control of AM SS.

    Encryption policy:
    - only package models are encrypted (i.e., not individual files)
    - once encrypted, a package records its encryption key's fingerprint in the
      db (and in the pointer file for encrypted compressed AIPs)
    - re-encryption always uses the original GPG key (not the current key of
      the space)
    - re-encryption with a different key must be explicit (although this is not
      implemented yet; TODO (?))
